## Connecting Raspberry Pi/DHT11, Node Red, and Power BI with OpenBiotech

For many, the Internet of Things (IoT) can seem like a difficult challenge, especially thinking through getting an end-to-end IoT Solution out the door (or stood up for the first time).  In this post, we'll take you step-by-step through the process of setting up your own personal temperature sensor with OpenBiotech. Here's a look at what we'll do:

- Configure and set up a Raspberry Pi
- Connect a temperature sensor
- Read the data with Node-Red
- Use OpenBiotech to stream sensor data
- Leverage helpful data tools from your dashboard
- Visualize your data with PowerBI

This may seem like a lot, and can take some teams weeks or even months.  So grab your gear, and we'll have you up and running in the next 30 - 60 minutes.

### Things you will need

In this walk through, we use the Model 3B Raspberry Pi (but you can use a Model 4 as well) and a DHT11 sensor.  If you're like me, you may have as many as 3 or more Raspberry Pis laying around your house.  Mix this with a multitude of sensors and starter kits, and you'll quickly get a sense for why my wife made me move to the garage.  

If this is you, dust off an RPi and if you don't have a DHT11, grab another sensor and make the necessary adjustments when we hook up Node Red.  If that isn't you or you're somewhere in between, you may have to make a few quick purchases and gather some supplies:

- [Raspberry Pi](https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Premium-Clear-Supply/dp/B07BC7BMHY/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=raspberry+pi&qid=1611254779&sr=8-8) with a Power Source
- [MicroSD card](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Ultra-microSDHC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GY9NYRM/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2XJMC54SCHQQD&dchild=1&keywords=micro+sd+card+32gb&qid=1610743336&sprefix=micro+sd+card%2Caps%2C229&sr=8-3), at least 16GB
- [DHT11 or DHT22 humidity/temperature sensor w/ wires.](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Temperature-Humidity-Digital-3-3V-5V/dp/B01DKC2GQ0) DHT11 will be used for this tutorial.
- A [Fathym OpenBiotech](https://dashboard.openbiotech.co/) account
- [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/)
- A USB Keyboard and mouse
- A computer monitor
- Your normal computer with an SD card reader (or you can buy an SD to USB dongle)

## Part 1: Setting up the Raspberry Pi

This process includes putting the Raspberry Pi Operating System (formerly known as Raspbian) onto your micro SD card and interacting with the Pi to complete initial setup (Connect to Wifi, allow permissions to access your Pi from another computer, etc).

The official Raspberry Pi website has an excellent tool called the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/), which walks you through the process of creating an SD card that will power and control your Raspberry PI.

:::note

For more information on the RPi imager, [read here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-imager-imaging-utility/).

:::

Now that you have your SD card ready to go, we can fire up the Pi! You will need to plug your keyboard and mouse into 2 of the 4 USB inputs on the Pi, and plug in a monitor with an HDMI cable.

Once all peripherals are connected, plug in the power source and connect it to the Pi. This should open the Raspberry Pi OS first time setup wizard on the monitor.  Navigate through the provided steps, which will include connecting the Pi to WiFi.

:::note

More information on that wizard process can be found [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspbian-update-june-2018/).  You can skip over the **Recommended Software** portion if desired, it is not important to this tutorial

:::

## Part 2 - Installing Software on the Raspberry Pi

After completing the setup steps in Part 1, you will be taken to the main Raspberry Pi desktop.  In the top left, click on the Raspberry logo, which will show a drop down of options.  Click on the **Programming** tab, then click **Terminal**.

In order to program our Pi and get connected, we will need to install a couple of tools first, mainly Node.js and Node-Red by completing the following terminal commands:

1. To update the system package list run  
`sudo apt-get update`  
2. Install the latest versions of system packages with  
`sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`  
3. Get the Node.js package we need to install by running  
`curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_current.x | sudo -E bash`  
4. To install the Node.js package  
`sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`  
5. Finally download and install Node Red with command  
`bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/node-red/linux-installers/master/deb/update-nodejs-and-nodered)`

Once all commands have been run in the terminal, the RPi is setup with Node Red.

:::note

For more advanced users, there is an option to control your Raspberry Pi remotely using SSH, instead of using a monitor, keyboard and mouse. More information and instructions can be found [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/).

:::

## Part 3 - Wire up the DHT11 Sensor

Next, we need to wire up the DHT11 sensor to the Raspberry Pi. Thankfully, this simple sensor doesn’t need any complex wiring, resistors, or breadboards. Simply follow the wiring diagram provided below:

![Modified Pi Wiring](https://www.fathym.com/iot/img/modifiedPiWiring.png)

The [GPIO pins](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/) allow the Raspberry Pi to control and monitor the outside world by being connected to electronic circuits.  It's important to be aware of which pin is which.  The DHT11 Sensor has been wired as follows:

- DHT11 Positive – Pi PIN 4 (Power)
- DHT11 Negative – Pi PIN 20 (Ground)
- DHT11 Out – Pi PIN 7 (Data)

:::note

You can check [here](https://pinout.xyz/#) for more information on other pin configurations for your sensors and equipment.

:::

## Part 4 - Using Node-Red to Read Sensor Data

Once you’re done wiring your sensor, go back to your terminal window on the Raspberry Pi. Then enter the command `node-red-start` which will start the node red service. When the service starts, the terminal will look similar to this:

![Node Red Service Terminal](https://steemitimages.com/DQmZreKyQYHjEe2KUJHdHT4dGPNtofUqbcct6WLRx8rfHJs/Inkedterminal_LI.jpg)

In the top right, there will be a URL that usually starts with '**http://192…**' (inside the red box above). You can then use the built in Raspberry Pi web browser to navigate to this website.  You will then be taken to a screen that looks like this:

![Node Red Interface](https://steemitimages.com/640x0/https://steemitimages.com/DQmTsV5oGxLJa3MgJWrqQJ43a5SfdKJDrqtY1yjWJuBRD4J/DQmTsV5oGxLJa3MgJWrqQJ43a5SfdKJDrqtY1yjWJuBRD4J.png)

Welcome to Node-Red! There are a few additional modules that we will need in order to create our device flow. In the top right corner of the screen, click on the <img src="https://www.fathym.com/iot/img/screenshots/icon-node-red-menu.png" class="text-image" />, and then click **Manage palette**. On the new screen, click on the **Install** tab. In the search bar, type in the following and install each of them:

- node-red-contrib-azure-iot-hub
- node-red-contrib-dht-sensor

For the sake of simplicity, we are able to import previously created flows into Node Red. The following flow template takes temperature and humidity information from the DHT11, formats the JSON payload to use OpenBiotech's Best Practice Schema (in addition, uses a few extra fields like **key** and **protocol** to work with the Azure IoT Hub module), and takes a reading every 30 seconds. To use this template, copy the following Node-Red JSON template:

```

In the Node-Red browser screen, click on the <img src="https://www.fathym.com/iot/img/screenshots/icon-node-red-menu.png" class="text-image" /> at the top right of the screen, and choose **Import**. Paste the JSON into the text box, and click **Import**. You will now have a visual representation of the flow of data from the device.

:::note

If you chose to use a sensor other than the DHT11, you can still start from the provided template.  Once the template is imported, you can work with Node Red to swap out the dht-sensor for the one you chose.  Node Red packages for your devices can be found by [searching here](https://flows.nodered.org/search?term=dht11).

:::

Before we start sending actual device readings, we first need to provide Node Red some device configuration information. This is where OpenBiotech comes in!

## Part 5 - Configuring OpenBiotech

Before we can tell your device where to send data, we first need somewhere to send the data.  There are a number of different ways this can be accomplished, with OpenBiotech the focus is helping you leverage best practice cloud IoT technology.  Here we'll be using the Azure IoT Hub to connect devices to a data flow and then make it available downstream for use in other applications.

Follow these steps to create a new device in OpenBiotech. For more details on the full OpenBiotech experience, check out our [full documentation](https://www.openbiotech.co/docs/getting-started/devices).

Start by navigating to the [OpenBiotech Dashboard](https://dashboard.openbiotech.co/) and sign in or sign up. 

### Enroll a Device

After the IoT Infrastructure has been provisioned, the second section of the OpenBiotech getting started workflow is to start connecting devices. Register a name for your device (i.e. my-first-device) and click **Save Device**.  That’s it!  Your device is now registered, the shared access keys and connection strings will be available to be copied a little further in the setup process. 

![Biotech Connect Devices Step 1](https://www.fathym.com/img/screenshots/biotech_device_config_1.png)

After setting up your dashboards in the next step, click on the ![Icon Copy](https://www.fathym.com/iot/img/screenshots/bt_copy_button.png) next to your connection string to copy to your clipboard. 

![Biotech Connection String](https://www.fathym.com/img/screenshots/connection-string-copy-button-highlight.png)

Your connection string should look something like this:

> HostName=**YourHostName**;DeviceId=**YourDeviceID**;SharedAccessKey=**YourDeviceKey**

Within the connection string, there are three key parts that we need: The **HostName**, the **DeviceID**, and the **SharedAccessKey**. All of these values need to be a part of either the data payload, or as a config value. Let's add them now.

### Update Node Red

 Copy **YourHostName**, **YourDeviceID** and **YourDeviceKey** portions of your connection string (not including the "**Hostname=**", "**DeviceId=**", "**SharedAccessKey=**", or the "**;**" at the end of each value).  Go back to your Node-Red browser, and double click on the yellow **Format JSON** module, which will pull up a **Properties** screen, shown below.

Next, click on the three-dot menu screen (shown in the red box below). This will pull up an "Edit" screen for your flow.

![Format JSON Properties Updated](https://www.fathym.com/iot/img/screenshots/format-json-properties-new.png)

 From here, take the **YourDeviceID** and **YourDeviceKey** values from your connection string and paste them into the properties shown in the red boxes below. Click **Done**, and then **Done** again to close the module properties screen.

![Replace ID and key](https://www.fathym.com/iot/img/screenshots/replace-id-and-key-new.png)

:::note

For this specific example, **DeviceID** has to be entered twice. This is because the Azure IoT Hub module requires the DeviceID in order to build a connection string. The IoT Hub itself also requires a DeviceID in the data payload.

:::

Next, double click on the **"Azure IoT Hub"** node module. This will open a **Properties** screen, shown below.  Take your **HostName**, and paste it into the red box shown above. Click **Done**, and then **Done** again to close the module properties screen.

![Update Hostname](https://www.fathym.com/iot/img/screenshots/update_hostname.png)

Once this is complete, click the red **Deploy** button in the top right corner. Your Pi is now sending real time data to OpenBiotech! Simply visit your OpenBiotech dashboard and investigate your data payloads.

![OpenBiotech Dashboard Device Telemetry](https://www.fathym.com/iot/img/screenshots/mj-ob-device-data-dashboard.png)

## Part 6 - Connecting Data to Power BI Desktop

There are a lot of options in Power BI Desktop for importing data to be used in reports and visualizations for data interpretation.  OpenBiotech provides connection URLs and Storage Access Keys so you can import data from your devices into Power BI using the **Web** data source.

Your OpenBiotech Dashboard will give you access to API Access Storage Keys as well as obtain request URLs for cold and warm storage queries.  This is all you need to get started visualizing data with Power BI!

### OpenBiotech Storage Access

OpenBiotech provides out of the box APIs that allow you to interact with your data and devices.  Leveraging the cold query endpoint will allow us to easily connect with Power BI.

![API Storage Access](https://www.fathym.com/iot/img/screenshots/biotech_api_storage_access_dark_highlights.png)

To quickly copy storage access keys use the ![Icon Copy](https://www.fathym.com/iot/img/screenshots/bt_copy_button.png) button

:::note

OpenBiotech Storage Access can be leveraged to connect to many diffrent types of services, check the [full documentation](https://www.openbiotech.co/docs/integrations/connecting-downstream) for more details.

:::

### Configuring Power BI Desktop

Make sure that you've downloaded and installed [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/).  Once installed, launch it and go to **Get Data -> Web**. As you may have guessed, this data source will allow you to import data from the web.

![Power BI Get Data Web](https://www.fathym.com/iot/img/screenshots/power-bi-get-data-web.png)

Once this has been selected, a popup will appear allowing input of the API URL. You will need to select the **Advanced** radio button to input the **Access Key** as an additional header parameter.

![Power BI From Web Advanced](https://www.fathym.com/iot/img/screenshots/power-bi-from-web-advanced.png)

The API request URL can be obtained from the dashboard using either the cold or warm query APIs.  Here is a sample warm query URL you can start with, and the dashboard will assist in discovering the parameters for this query.

```console
https://dashboard.openbiotech.co/api/data/warm/explorer
```

Now input the request URL from above (or obtained from the dashboard) into the Power BI **URL Parts** text field.  Then enter `Authorization` as a header parameter key, along with the **Bearer (token)** copied from OpenBiotech Dashboard in the value text field.

![Power BI From web Advanced Enter Values](https://www.fathym.com/iot/img/screenshots/biotech-power-bi-from-web-advanced-enter-values.png)

With these values entered, select **OK** and the Power Query Editor will load your payloads.  These will need to be converted to a JSON source and a table before you can visualize your data.

### Preparing Data for Use

Now that the data is connected into our report, we need to convert it to a table.  Do this by selecting **To Table** and then **OK** from the following popup.

![Power BI Get Data Web to Table](https://www.fathym.com/iot/img/screenshots/power-bi-get-data-web-to-table.png)

![Power BI Get Data Web to Table Prompt](https://www.fathym.com/iot/img/screenshots/power-bi-get-data-web-to-table-prompt.png)

The data is still showing as a single complex option.  Select the **expand arrows** icon and Power BI will begin to break down the complex object into columns.

![Power BI Get Data Web Table Expand](https://www.fathym.com/iot/img/screenshots/power-bi-get-data-web-table-expand.png)

After converting to a table and expanding the record, you may notice that some columns still say **Record**. You will need to repeat this expanding process on those columns to expose the nested json data for use in Power BI.

Congratulations! The device data has now been loaded into Power BI. The final step before you can use the data in visualizations is to transform the data from a Text type to Number, Dates, and other types.

### Transforming Data with Power BI

Transforming Data with power BI will allow you to customize data based on requirements. Power BI allows the user to remove duplicate values, create new columns, define table headers, convert data types, use calculated columns etc.  Power BI has an incredible number of features that are dedicated to helping clean and prepare data for analysis.  You may want to use Power Query Editor to clean up and shape this data before you start building reports.

Additional information on how to shape your data can be found all over the internet, here are a couple places to get started.  You may want a learning path for [cleaning, transforming and loading data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/clean-data-power-bi/), and to expand on that, look into [shaping and combing data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-shape-and-combine-data#shape-data).
  
When your query is where you want it, select **Close & Apply** from Power Query Editor's File menu.

![Power BI Get Data Web Close and Apply](https://www.fathym.com/iot/img/screenshots/power-bi-get-data-web-close-apply.png)

This action applies the changes and closes the editor.  The transformed dataset appears in the Power BI Desktop, ready to be used for creating reports.

### Visualize Data with Power BI

Now that you have transformed and loaded your data, it is time to prepare reports and visualizations for data interpretation and analysis.  In the Fields pane on the right, you see the fields in the data model you just transformed and created.

![Power BI Data Fields](https://www.fathym.com/iot/img/screenshots/power-bi-data-fields.png)

Power BI can help you create compelling reports where you can change visualizations, customize colors or axes, apply filters, drag fields, and more!  All these changes are fun to do, easy to undo, and quick to take effect.  The **Visualizations** pane provides the tools necessary for adding and configuring multiple visualizations.  Power BI has a growing list of visualizations you can download and use in your own reports that transforms complicated data into something easy to understand.  This ease provides insights to make informed decisions quickly.

![Power BI Get Data Web Close and Apply](https://www.fathym.com/iot/img/screenshots/power-bi-visualizations.png)

Additional information on how to visualize and bring your data to life can be located across the internet.  You can get started on [building your report](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-excel-stunning-report#build-your-report) and work through a quick [10 minute example](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-your-first-power-bi-report/4-exercise-create-visuals-in-power-bi) to get you going.
